<h2 class="hcontent">WHAT IS SCIENCE?</h2>
<p class="pcontent">Science is present everywhere. It is the main fundamental of our existence. It is the collection of data about the nature and the physical structure
of our surroundings via the collection and identification of data done by observation and experimentation. For generations, we have used it to discover new
knowledge and utilized it for our development purposes. As time passes by, our science knowledge became more and more diverse. We discovered many new types
of knowledge along the way, which will eventually be divided into different categories, or branches.</p>

<h2 class="hcontent">WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF SCIENCE?</h2>

<b>Physics</b>. Each branch has its distinct coverage of topics. We will specify the coverages of each branch of science. To find them, you must
