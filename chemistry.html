<h2 class="hcontent">WHAT IS CHEMISTRY?</h2>
<p class="pcontent">Chemistry is the study of matter. Specifically, it is the study of the processes of different substances. In Chemistry,
we study the different properties and characteristics of certain substances. Chemistry is everywhere, just like the other branches of science.
It can be found from the reactions of your simple kitchen ingredients up to the reactions of the most complex chemicals in a labratory.</p>

<div class="content">
<h2 class="hcontent">WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF CHEMISTRY?</h2>
<p class="pcontent">There's not much branches of chemistry, unlike Biology, so we will only be discussing about the 5 branches of Chemistry.
Below are some of the branches of Chemistry.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Organic Chemistry</b></dt>
<dd>- It is the study of organic compounds. It involves compounds that contain C-H bonds.</dd>
<dt><b>Inorganic Chemistry</b></dt>
<dd>- The opposite of organic chemistry, It involves the study of inorganic compounds. Unlike its counterpart, it involves compounds that contain
C-H bonds.</dd>
<dt><b>Analytical Chemistry</b></dt>
<dd>- It is the analytical measuring of matter which applies qualitative and quantitative analysis.</dd>
<dt><b>Physical Chemistry</b></dt>
<dd>- It is the study of chemistry which involves physics. It applies thermodynamics and mechanics to chemistry.</dd>
<dt><b>Biochemistry</b></dt>
<dd>- It is the study of chemical substances and processes located inside plants or animals. It is basically a mix of chemistry and biology.</dd>

<h2 class="hcontent">WHO ARE THE SCIENTISTS INVOLVED WITH CHEMISTRY?</h2>
<p class="pcontent">There are many scientists involved with Chemistry, so for today, i will only be discussing about 2 scientists.</p>

<h3 class="hcontent">DMITRI MENDELEEV</h3>
<p class="pcontent">Dimitri Mendeleev (January 24, 1834 - January 27, 1907), a Russian chemist, was known as the father of the periodic table
of elements. He created the periodic classification of the elements by arranging the elements in ascending order based on their atomic weight.
He also founded the <b>Periodic Law</b>.</p>

<h3 class="hcontent">ANTOINE LAVOISIER</h3>
<p class="pcontent">Antoine Lavoisier (August 26, 1743 - May 8, 1794) was a French chemist. He developed the law of conservation of mass,
modern system of naming chemical formulas, and the theory of the chemical reactivity of oxygen.</p>
