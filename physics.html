<h2 class="hcontent">WHAT IS PHYSICS?</h2>
<p class="pcontent">Physics is the study That deals with the structure and mechanics of matter. It also involves the physical behavior of matter,
specifically, movement caused by force. Its main purpose is to find explanations about certain phenomena associated with physical action.</p>

<h2 class="hcontent">WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF PHYSICS?</h2>
<p class="pcontent">Physics has a lot of branches. But for now, we will only discuss about 6 of these branches. Below are some of the branches of Physics.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Classica Mechanics</b></dt>
<dd>- This is considered the most basic branch of physics as it only covers forces amongst matter such as motion and inertia. It also involves force as
energy such as kinetic or potential energy.</dd>
<dt><b>Thermodynamics</b></dt>
<dd>- It is the study of the behavior of matter  with the application of heat and pressure.</dd>
<dt><b></b>Electromagnetism and Photonics</dt>
<dd>- It is the study of the behavior of electrons, magnetism, and photons, or to be exact, electricity, magnetism, and light.</dd>
<dt><b>Quantum mechanics or Molecular physics</b></dt>
<dd>- It is the study of the physical behavior of matter in a molecular or atomic scale.</dd>
<dt><b>Optics</b></dt>
<dd>- It is the study of the behavior of light, mainly about reflection, refraction, etc.</dd>
<dt><b>Cosmology</b></dt>
<dd>- It is the study of the universe, its origins and what will happen to it. Both Physics and Astrophysics are associated with this topic.</dd>

<h2 class="hcontent">WHO ARE THE SCIENTISTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHEMISTRY?</h2>
<p class="pcontent">Thhere are many physicists out there, so I will only be discussing about 2 scientists.</p>

<h3 class="hcontent">ALBERT EINSTEIN</h3>
<p class="pcontent">Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 - April 18, 1955) is one of the most famous scientists known. He was a German physicist
who invented the theory of relativity and explained the photoelectric effect. One of his most famous inventions is the formula E=mc<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h3 class="hcontent">ISAAC NEWTON</h3>
<p class="pcontent">Isaac Newton (born December 25, 1642 — March 20, 1727), or Sir Isaac Newton, is also one of the most famous scientists
known. He discovered the integration of colors in white light, which gave birth to the science of Optics. He also invented the 3 laws
of motion, which would become the fundamentals of modern-day Physics.</p>
